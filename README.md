# MIPS Speed Violation Checker

This MIPS assembly program prompts the user to enter their driving speed and the roadâ€™s speed limit, validates both inputs, and determines if a speeding violation has occurred. Depending on how much the speed exceeds the limit, it displays the appropriate fine or legal consequence.

## Features
- Input validation for speed and limit
- Conditional fine and penalty logic
- Clean and readable MIPS assembly structure

## How to Run
1. Open the program in **MARS** or **SPIM**.
2. Assemble and run the program.
3. Enter your current speed and road speed limit when prompted.
4. View the result based on your input.
